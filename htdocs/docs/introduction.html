        <h2>Introduction to AssaultCube</h2>
        <p>
          AssaultCube has a simple theme; two teams on a single battle ground. There's no story, just on-going
          destruction &amp; ownage.
        </p>
        <img src="images/flag_cla.jpg" alt="CLA" style="float : right; margin : 25px 5px 5px 10px;">
        <div id="cla" style="font-size : 15px; font-weight : bold;">Team CLA: The Cubers Liberation Army</div>
        <div style="text-align : justify;">
          Little is known about the goals or motivations of this small, but feared terrorist group. Their activities are
          as diverse as their members.
          With ex-military, anarchists, religious fanatics, conspiracy theorists, tripping hippies, free &#169; software
          fanatics&#8482;, or simply severely mentally disordered persons and bored youngsters, this organization is a
          pool of radicals from across the globe.<br>
          Their operations range from simple annoyances (such as introducing hallucinogenic drugs into air conditioning
          systems of largely populated offices or malls), to well planned gruesome bombings.
          They'll target civilians, as well as politicians, lobbyists or religious leaders and their employees.<br>
          Their selfish motto: <i>"Terror for the sake of terror, because you all suck!"</i>
        </div>
        <br>
        <img src="images/flag_rvsf.jpg" alt="RVSF" style="float : left; margin : 10px 10px 5px 5px;">
        <div id="rvsf" style="font-size : 15px; font-weight : bold;">Team RVSF: The Rabid Viper Special Forces</div>
        <div style="text-align : justify;">
          An elite group of special armed forces, but not the kind you'd expect. RVSF is made up of battle worn fighters
          and mercenaries, who might've been just a little too trigger happy and up for the glory to fit into any other
          kind of elite squad. They're not suitable where lives are to be spared and private or public property to
          remain intact.<br>
          Any associated parties to this extravagant task-force remain well concealed for obvious
          reasons. Their primary targets are highly unpredictable terrorists and organized criminals such as the CLA,
          where intelligence, infiltration and stealth would just be a waste of time.<br>
          Their policy is simple: <i>"Shoot first, then ask questions later... if anyone is left to ask".</i>

        <h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
        <p>
          There are eight weapons available for you to frag &amp; gib your enemies with.
          Every player spawns with the standard outfitting of three weapons: a knife, a pistol &amp; a primary weapon.
          Grenades must be picked up along the way. To change your primary weapon, press B for the weapons menu and select the one you want.
          Next time you spawn, you will spawn with that weapon.
        </p>
        <div class="weps2">
          <img src="images/weapon_knife.jpg" alt="Knife" class="weps1">
          <b>Swiss Tech Combat Blade DR-88</b><br>
          A sharp and swift blade. It's your last resort when you run out of ammo, as well as your best friend
          in humiliating snipers and campers. "Slash" with this weapon &amp; you'll gain two frags, instead of one.
        </div>
        <div class="weps2">
          <img src="images/weapon_pistol.jpg" alt="Pistol" class="weps1">
          <b>Mk-77 Semi-Automatic Pistol</b><br>
          Your basic sidearm. A powerful secondary weapon, yet typically less effective at range.
          The small magazine size is something you need to keep an eye on. The <a href="#akimbo">akimbo</a>
          power-up makes this weapon twice as deadly and much more fun!
        </div>
        <div class="weps2">
          <img src="images/weapon_assault.jpg" alt="Assault rifle" class="weps1">
          <b>MTP-57 Assault Rifle</b><br>
          The large calibre deals a substantial amount of damage, with a surprising amount of recoil.
          A long barrel ensures accuracy even at high range.
          It can become difficult to control when shooting bursts of more than three bullets.
        </div>
        <div class="weps2">
          <img src="images/weapon_sniper.jpg" alt="Sniper rifle" class="weps1">
          <b>Precision Tech AD-81 Sniper Rifle</b><br>
          Semi-Automatic Sniper rifle, equipped with a scope. The large calibre can do a frightful amount of damage.
          Though naturally most accurate when used with the scope, the highly ergonomic design allows the experienced shooter
          to operate it from the hip as well.
          <br>
          Not recommended on its own reduce time of a matchfor hand-to-hand combat, since it can take some time
          to recock the weapon. Shots to the head from this weapon produce a "headshot" instead of a frag,
          which causes instant death and counts for two frags, instead of one.
        </div>
        <div class="weps2">
          <img src="images/weapon_subgun.jpg" alt="Sub-machine gun" class="weps1">
          <b>A-ARD/10 Sub-machine Gun</b><br>
          This weapon releases a deadly spray of bullets at a high rate of fire.
          However, due to the short barrel and small calibre,
          its man-stopping power is limited, and effectiveness ceases at longer ranges. Like the Assault Rifle,
          its accuracy gets worse the longer your bursts.
        </div>
        <div class="weps2">
          <img src="images/weapon_shotgun.jpg" alt="Shotgun" class="weps1">
          <b>V-19 Combat Shotgun</b><br>
          A 7-round pump-action shotgun (pump action is done automatically).
          <br>This powerful weapon can shred your opponents to pieces - if you're close enough.
        </div>
        <div class="weps2">
          <img src="images/weapon_carbine.jpg" alt="Carbine" class="weps1">
          <b>TMP-M&amp;A Carbine</b><br>
          The perfect weapon for the most accurate shooter. Faster than a sniper rifle and more deadly than an automatic;
          just make sure you're pointing it in the right direction. Its 10-round magazine will let you dispose
          of five unarmoured opponents before you need to reload. Its ability to "pierce" your enemies' armour vests will increase
          your chances to stand your ground.
        </div>
        <div class="weps2">
          <img src="images/weapon_grenade.jpg" alt="Grenade" class="weps1">
          <b>SAL-T3 Grenade</b><br>
          This grenade is your friend in mid range fights. Its timer is adjusted to two seconds which makes it quite
          useful for quick responses to your enemies fire bursts. Kills from this weapon produce a "gib" instead of a
          frag.
        </div>
