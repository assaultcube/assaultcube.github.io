          The game objectives of AssaultCube are simple and straightforward:
        </p>
        <ol style="margin-left : 50px;">
          <li>Find the enemy.</li>
          <li>Frag or gib the enemy.</li>
          <li>REPEAT!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There are also <a href="introduction.html#flagmodes">flag-based modes</a>,
          which have other, more exciting objectives.
        </p>
        <h4 id="controls">
          Controls
        </h4>
        <p>
          After knowing the controls, most things in AssaultCube are relatively straightforward.
          Press <b>W</b> to move forwards and then move your mouse around to change
          directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Left-click when aimed at an enemy to attack them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a list of all the other controls (map editing controls are <a href="mapediting1.html#controls">here</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also assign custom keys to specific weapons by using the keybinding menu
          in-game.
          This can be found by pressing <b>ESC</b> and then navigating to: <b>Settings</b> &#8658; <b>Keyboard settings...</b> .

          The masterserver will be queried and provide you with a list of servers, like the image above.
          This list of servers then gets saved in <i>config/servers.cfg</i> for next time.
          If the <a href="interface.html#console">console</a> says "master server
          not replying", then that means your client failed to download the list of servers
          to play upon, and you will need to click on "<b>Force serverlist update</b>" until it updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish, you can sort the server browser using your left/right keys. Press F1 in this menu
          to see other available options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly by using the <b>Custom connect</b> menu and
          then enter a valid IP or DNS name of a server &amp; the port number
          (and optionally a password, if the server uses one).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> Although the AssaultCube game engine is open source, you are warned that if you make
          gameplay-affecting modifications to your client, and then connect to a public server, you could
          be banned from servers and/or the game's <a href="https://wiki.cubers.net/action/view/Master_server">
          master server</a>. Remember that when you play online, you are playing against other humans, not
          bots, and they would like you to play fair.<br>
          DO NOT CHEAT IN PUBLIC SERVERS.

        <p>
          Starting a single-player game is simple. Press <b>ESC</b>, navigate to <b>Singleplayer</b>, then choose
          the mode, bot skill, amount of enemies and the map. Then, a game with computer-bot enemies will start immediately.
        </p>
        <h4 style="margin-top : 55px;">
          Changing settings
        </h4>
        <p>
          Most important setting changes can actually be changed from within the menus. So,
          press <b>ESC</b> and then <b>Settings</b>. There are many important settings in
          this menu that can be changed, including changing your name and team. Look in there
          for what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other settings which can't be found inside the menu. These settings
          can be changed via the <a href="interface.html#console">console</a>. Check out the
          <a href="reference.xml">reference</a> to find out about those settings and how they can be changed.
        </p>

        <h4 style="margin-top : 30px;">
          Choosing a weapon
        </h4>
        <p>
          To select a primary weapon, press <b>B</b> to show the weapon menu.
          Through this menu you'll be able to choose any of the five
          <a href="introduction.html#weapons">primary weapons</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will then receive the weapon when you next respawn.
          If you want the weapon straight away, type <span class="code">/suicide</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can select between your primary weapon, pistol/akimbo, grenade or knife
          by selecting them using the keys 1-4, or by scrolling through them with your mouse.
          Pressing <b>G</b> or right click will throw a grenade.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Quick nade throw</b>: If you want to throw a grenade and then quickly switch
          back to your normal weapon, press and hold the right mouse button and then let go
          to throw the grenade. After throwing the grenade (if you clicked and held it) then
          it will switch back to your normal weapon.
        </p>

          Orientation
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you can't find your way around the map, you can use the mini-map in the top-right
          corner of your screen (see right). Also, a bigger version of the map can be shown
          by pressing <b>ALT</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To learn more about the mini-map, see <a href="interface.html#minimap">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h4 style="padding-top : 25px;">
          Talking/Chatting
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you want to say something to other players, it's very simple. Just press <b>T</b>
          to bring up the console where you can type whatever you would like.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to make sure what you say is said only to the players on your team (if
          in a team mode), then press <b>Y</b>. This will bring up the console with a <i>%</i>
          sign in-front of it. The <i>%</i> sign is what is needed in front of <i>ANYTHING</i>
          you say to make it be seen <i>ONLY</i> by your team.
        </p>
        <h4 id="gib">
          Gibs
        </h4>
        <p>
          "<i>Gibs</i>" are a great way of defeating another player. If you want to gain many
          points quickly, this is the way to go about it. Deaths by gib count for <b>2</b> frags!
          Gibs are created by: Sniper rifle headshots and deaths from knife slashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although they don't count for extra frags, it should be noted that death by grenade blasts
          and blank-range shotgun create the same messy effect.
        </p>
        <h4 id="voting">
          Voting
        </h4>
        <p>
          Voting can be used to do many various things in Multiplayer, such as changing mode/map,
          forcing a team change, changing mastermode, kicking or banning a player, setting autoteam
          and removing bans.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make these votes through the menus in-game. When connected, press <b>ESC</b> and
          click on <b>Set mode/map...</b>. This can also be done through commands if you prefer, example:
          typing the command <span class="code">/ctf ac_mines</span> would start a vote for ac_mines in CTF mode.
          <b>Note</b>: There are time limits between votes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use <b>F1</b> to vote for votes that appear at the bottom left of your screen and
          use <b>F2</b> to vote against them.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Spectating
        </h4>
        <p>
          Once fragged, you can spectate a game simply by pressing the space bar.
          Using your mouse to scroll will change the player you are spectating. Pressing the
          space bar will scroll through 3 different spectate modes: Normal spectate, follow-player
          or <span class="titletext" title="the player you spectate becomes transparent">follow with ghost</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also spectate by pressing <b>ESC</b> in-game and clicking on "Change to spectate mode".
        </p>
        <h4>
          Voice-com
        </h4>
        <p>
          Voice-coms are a nifty way to quickly communicate common phrases to other players.
          To use the voice-coms during a multiplayer game, press <b>V</b>.
          Then, using numbers, select the voice-com you would like to say.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Screenshots
        </h4>
        <p>
          Most players use screenshots as a way of keeping a record of their scores. If you only need screenshots to do
          this, it's recommended to turn on "Auto-screenshot", which automatically takes a screenshot during intermission
          (while the scoreboard is showing) of every game you play.
          This can be done in the <b>Settings</b> &#8658; <b>Misc settings...</b> menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also adjust the image quality of these screenshots through this menu.
        <p>
          You can create a screenshot at anytime during the game by pressing <b>F12</b> or by typing <span class="code">/screenshot</span>.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Demos
        </h4>
        <p>
          Demos are a little bit like video recordings of the game, except what they really
          do is record all the data sent/received in the game so it can be replayed later (it is not
          a video file!). Demos are recorded on THE SERVER only (as recording demos locally
          causes issues).
        </p>
        <p>
          Demos are recorded on all servers by default. However, if they've been disabled on the server you're on,
          you can only get them recorded if you are an <b>ADMIN</b> and have the server's admin password.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
          When demos are recorded, you'll be prompted to download it by pressing <b>F10</b> and if pressed, your demo will be downloaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to download a previous demo that's still located on the server,
          press <b>ESC</b> in-game and use: <b>Download a demo...</b> in the menu.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Playing and sending custom maps
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you want to play a custom map online, then there are three requirements to get it running:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make a quality map - If your map does not fulfill the default quality
            requirements, after sending it to the server, your map will be rejected, with
            an explanation as to what quality requirement hasn't been fulfilled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start the map - This is done by voting for the map and mode to be played.
            This can be done through the menus as shown in <a href="#voting">voting</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Send the map - This is done by typing <span class="code">/sendmap</span>. This will send the map
            file stored on your computer to all the other players so that you can properly play the map.
            If the map has a config file, it will send that also.
            <br><b>Note</b>: You or the server MUST already have the map file to be able to play a custom map!
          </li>

          If you would like to reset all your controls back to the defaults, you can type
          the <span class="code">/resetbinds</span> command. Alternatively, you can find this inside <b>Settings</b>
          &#8658; <b>Keyboard settings...</b> by choosing <b>Reset all keybinds to default settings...</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to be able to reset all settings AND controls to default
          values, you can do this easily by typing <span class="code">/resetcfg 1</span>. You can also do this through
          the <b>Settings</b> menu by selecting <b>Reset all settings...</b> .
        </p>
        <p>
          "resetcfg" deletes the saved.cfg and init.cfg files which contains all user-chosen settings
          for AssaultCube. You will need to restart AssaultCube for this to take effect.
