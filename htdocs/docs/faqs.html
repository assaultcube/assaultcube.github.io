        <h2>F.A.Q'S</h2>
        <p>
          Only frequently asked questions are answered on this page. If you've looked through the
          rest of the official documentation and still can't find the answer you need, you might like
          to try <a href="https://wiki.cubers.net/action/view/Special:Search">searching the wiki</a> and the
          <a href="https://forum.cubers.net/search.php">forums</a>, and if you still can't find the
          answer, post a thread on the forum explaining your situation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="n01">
            On the scoreboard, I've noticed the words "ping" and "pj", what are these?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            PJ means packet jump. Information about what these are is covered in the
            <a href="interface.html#scoreboard">interface part</a> of the documentation.
          </li>
          <li id="n02">
            Why do some players become semi-visible (transparent), stand still and start saluting?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag">network lag</a>.
            The AssaultCube server hasn't recieved a response from the player who is saluting for too long
            and so the AssaultCube server has temporarally turned that player into a "ghost" that can't be
            shot (but don't worry, they can't shoot you either). This "ghost" player will eventually, either
            disconnect, or their connection will catch-up and they will return to play.
          </li>
          <li id="n03">
            Why is a player's name on the scoreboard red in colour?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is because they're an administrator for this server. This means they know a password to that server,
            probably because they own/run the server, or are a friend of the person who owns/runs the server. As they
            have administrator access, they're able to do whatever they like on their server. Administrators can overide
            any votes initiated by normal players.
          </li>
          <li id="n04">
            I experience some motion sickness... is there any way around this?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Try increasing your <b>Field of View</b> or resolution. You can change these settings through the
            <b>Settings</b> &#187; <b>Video settings...</b> menu.
          </li>
          <li id="n05">
            What's a good way to get a lot of points, fast?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Try honing your skills into "<a href="basics.html#gib">gibbing</a>" your enemies instead of
            just normal fragging. You get given 2 frags for gibbing an enemy with a knife or sniper-headshot.
            Using grenades are also a great way for gibbing more than one enemy at once, but are only worth 1 frag.
          </li>
          <li id="n06">
            I seem to get strange walls appear out of nowhere on maps with far-away areas. How do I fix this?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is a graphics glitch caused by low "minlod". In AssaultCube, type: <b>/minlod 250</b> to set minlod
            to the maximum. You might like to try a lower value than 250 if you find this setting causes considerable
            graphical lag for you.
          </li>
          <li id="n07">
            Why doesn't AssaultCube have a feature that I've seen in a different game (example: Counter-Strike, etc.)?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Firstly, AssaultCube is not a Counter-Strike (etc.) clone! The quicker you understand this,
            the sooner you will be able to defeat your opponents with ease.
            <br>
            Secondly, just because a feature is available in some other game, it does not mean we have to implement it
            here. There are several reasons we might not add it, it might not suit the game style that AssaultCube has,
            it might not fit-in with the CUBE engine, etc. The best thing to do, is to
            <a href="https://github.com/assaultcube/AC/issues" target="_new">create a new issue</a> with your feature request and we may consider it.
          </li>
          <li id="n08">
            I shoot at players/bots, but NONE of my shots seem to hit them. What's going on?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            AssaultCube uses OpenGL to find the position in the 3D world your crosshair is pointing at - so this error
            occurs when buggy graphics cards aren't allowing OpenGL to do this properly. If you're able to, the best thing to
            do first is <a href="graphicsdrivers.html">update your graphics drivers</a> in an attempt to fix it permanently.
            <br>If this isn't possible or doesn't work, the next thing to try is changing your resolution <b>WITHIN</b>
            AssaultCube. You can change the resolution through the <b>Settings</b> &#187; <b>Video settings...</b> menu.
            <br>In most cases, this should be enough to fix it. For the new resolutions, first try setting the resolution
            to be the same as your native resolution, if that doesn't work, next try 1024x768 (and then 800x600, then 640x480).
            <br>Sometimes turning off full-scene antialising can fix the problem, to do that type <b>/fsaa 0</b> in the console in AssaultCube.
            <br>Failing this, there isn't much else that can be done, you may need to replace your graphics card.
          </li>
          <li id="n09">
            Why are my settings wiped everytime I start AssaultCube?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            If this occurs, it is because you need to enable write-access to your "AssaultCube home folder":
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419">Changing access permissions on Windows</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions#Changing%20Permissions">Changing access permissions on Linux</a></li>
            </ul>
            Although it is not recommended because of security reasons, as a last resort, you may try running AssaultCube
            as administrator/root to fix this issue.
          </li>
          <li id="n10">
            Where is my "AssaultCube home folder"?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            The "AssaultCube home (profile) folder" is used to save all of your AssaultCube screenshots, settings, maps, etc.
            You may also use this directory to add new content to the game found elsewhere, such as
            <a href="http://quadropolis.us/taxonomy/term/24">Quadropolis</a>.
            <br>Your home folder is either:
            <ul>
              <li style="font-weight : normal;">On Windows based systems: <i>My Documents\My Games\AssaultCube\</i>
              <li style="font-weight : normal;">On Linux based systems: <i>~/.assaultcube/</i>
              <li style="font-weight : normal;">On Mac based systems: <i>~/Library/Application Support/assaultcube/</i>
            </ul>
            Note 1: There will always be a version number appended to the end of the folder name.
            <br>Note 2: On Linux ~/ stands for "/home/YOUR_USERNAME" and on Mac for "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME".
            <br>Tip: press F12 to take a screenshot and see the path to profile.
          </li>
          <li id="n11">
            I've just installed a new AssaultCube package and I'm getting a lot of weird error messages, what do I do?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Sometimes after re-installing or upgrading AssaultCube the old configuration files still exist and the game is
            referencing those configuration files. But don't worry, there's an easy fix. Try typing the command
            <span class="code">/resetcfg 1</span> and then restart AssaultCube. If this doesn't work however, consult the
            <a href="index.html#helpmeplease">Help?!</a> section of the documentation.
          </li>
          <li id="n12">
            Why are my mouse clicks delayed when trying to fire rapidly in Linux?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is a common problem on Linux and isn't specific to AssaultCube. You'll need to edit your
            xorg.conf and set the value of <i>Emulate3Buttons</i> to OFF.
          </li>
          <li id="n13">
            Why does aiming seem difficult?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            Sometimes, your operating system has "mouse acceleration" activated, which can make aiming difficult, so
            you may need to turn this off. Another common problem is that the sensors on some "cheap" optical mice
            tend to miss detecting quick movements.
          </li>
          <li id="n14">
            How and where are settings saved?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            When AssaultCube is run for the first time, it executes:
            <ul class="code">
              <li style="font-weight : normal;">./config/defaults.cfg</li>
               <li style="font-weight : normal;">./config/autoexec.cfg</li>
            </ul>
            Once you quit AssaultCube, the settings in these files and your changes to them during the course of playing
            AssaultCube gets stored in <span class="code">./config/saved.cfg</span> and <span class="code">./config/init.cfg</span>
            (in your <a href="#n10">home folder</a>), so that upon the next load of AssaultCube, the game reads those files instead.
            The file <span class="code">./config/autoexec.cfg</span> is always executed upon every run of AssaultCube, this is
            so you can place scripts and commands you prefer inside this file, so they're automatically executed.
            If <span class="code">./config/init.cfg</span> doesn't exist, AssaultCube will prompt you with the
            quick setup menu.
            <br>To wipe settings to their default values, do one of the following:
            <ol>
              <li style="font-weight : normal;">
                Delete <span class="code">./config/saved.cfg</span>
                and <span class="code">./config/init.cfg</span>
              </li>
              <li style="font-weight : normal;">Type <span class="code">/resetcfg 1</span> while playing, then restart AssaultCube.</li>
              <li style="font-weight : normal;">Press ESCAPE and go to <b>Settings</b> &#8658; <b>Reset all settings</b> .</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li id="n15">
            Why does my desktop suddenly become stretched/big/etc, upon quitting AssaultCube?
          </li>
          <li class="ans">
            This is a graphics driver issue. So although we recommend that you <a href="graphicsdrivers.html">update your graphics drivers</a>,
            a quicker fix is to change the resolution inside of AssaultCube to be the same as your desktop resolution.
