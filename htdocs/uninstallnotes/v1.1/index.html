	<h2>Version 1.1 Uninstall Notes</h2>
	<p>
	  Thanks for playing AssaultCube. We hope you had a good time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  AssaultCube stores user-specific data like configuration and additional content in a separate directory.
	  <br>
	  Although you've removed AssaultCube from your system, this separate directory may still exist.
	  If you want to ensure all user-specific data is removed as well, you should delete the AssaultCube 
	  folder that is located in your <span class="code">My Documents</span> folder.
	  <br>
	  On Linux this folder is located in <span class="code">~/.assaultcube_v1.1</span>
	</p>
	<p>
          If you are uninstalling due to issues running AssaultCube, you may want to check for the answer in the
          <a href="../../docs">official documentation</a>.
          <br>
          If you still can't find the answer you need, 
          <a href="http://wiki.cubers.net/ac/Special:Search">search the wiki</a>, and the 
          <a href="http://forum.cubers.net/search.php">forums</a>, and if you
          still can't find the answer, post a thread on the forum explaining your situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would appreciate if you write us a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=123597&atid=697089">bug report</a>
          if there is a fault preventing you from running the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also try <a href="../../irc.html">IRC</a> for a real-time response, but be patient (at least 30mins), 
          as people "idle" in IRC, and may take time to respond.
